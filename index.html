        <button class="name">Yellowstone National Park</button>
        <div class="description">
          <p>Yellowstone National Park is a nearly 3,500-sq.-mile wilderness recreation area atop a volcanic hot spot. Mostly in Wyoming, the park spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho too. Yellowstone features dramatic canyons, alpine rivers, lush forests, hot springs and gushing geysers, including its most famous, Old Faithful. It's also home to hundreds of animal species, including bears, wolves, bison, elk and antelope.</p>

        <button class="name">Banff National Park</button>
        <div class="description">
          <p>Situated in southwestern Alberta, Canada's oldest national park is also one of its most beautiful. Visitors can explore Banff National Park on foot along more than 1,000 miles of hiking trails – the Lake Agnes Trail features a seasonal European-style tea house – or drive the scenic Icefields Parkway for breathtaking views of glaciers and waterfalls. For an unforgettable experience, take the Banff Gondola to the summit of Sulphur Mountain, where you will find a viewing boardwalk, a restaurant, an interpretive center and a multisensory theater.  </p>

        <button class="name">Serengeti National Park</button>
        <div class="description">
          <p>Tanzania's Serengeti National Park is the world-renowned home of The Great Migration. Every year, roughly 2 million wildebeests and hundreds of thousands of zebras and gazelles cross the park in search of food and breeding grounds. Predicting when this momentous event will occur can be tricky, so if you don't have that kind of flexibility, a traditional safari experience is your best bet. You'll have the chance to see Serengeti's incredible landscape, as well as animals like the Big Five – leopards, lions, elephants, buffaloes and rhinoceroses</p>
